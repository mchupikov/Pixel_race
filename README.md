## Pixel race by mchupikov (Максим Чупіков)
Pixel race is retro videogame, purpose of which is avoiding obstacles in the road, driving race car, and breaking new own records.

What about developing??? For developing my game I used pygame library. Nothing was difficult for me, but I'd prefer optimize my code. I also used module random for method choice and json module, for processing data of records and sound settings in json files. Graphical files I drew in Paint and Pixilart.com. Audiofiles were downloaded from the Internet.
